[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

Spring boot twitter clone for posting kitties and connecting their owners for breeding purposes (and more?).

## Requirements

For building and running the software you need:

- [JDK 1.8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3.5+](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine.

One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.mrmi.kitter.KitterApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
